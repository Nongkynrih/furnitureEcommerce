# furnitureEcommerce
This project demonstrates data analysis, feature engineering, and sales prediction on a furniture e-commerce dataset. It combines Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Power BI to provide predictive insights and interactive dashboards.

Project Overview

Cleaned and preprocessed e-commerce data, including handling missing values, price conversion, discount calculations, and categorical encoding.

Performed feature engineering in both Python and SQL to enrich the dataset for predictive modeling.

Built a Random Forest Regression model to predict the number of products sold.

Evaluated model performance:

RMSE: 31.07

RÂ² Score: 0.96

Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI using MySQL as the data source.

Developed a Flask API to serve predictions (optional for future integration).

Technologies Used

Python: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, matplotlib

SQL & MySQL: Data storage, cleaning, and feature engineering

Machine Learning: Random Forest Regression

Power BI: Interactive dashboards and visualization

Flask: Backend API for prediction serving

Project Workflow
